# The Python pass statement is a null statement.
#  But the difference between pass and comment is that comment is ignored by the interpreter whereas pass is not ignored.
# pass can be used as placeholder


# if True:
#     pass
# else:
#     print("Hii")


# class python:
#     pass


# def function():
#     pass


# Python pass keyword can be used with conditional statements.
# a = 10
# b = 20

# if(a<b):
#   pass
# else:
#   print("b<a")
